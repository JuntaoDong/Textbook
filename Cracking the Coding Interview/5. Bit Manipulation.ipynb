    "5.1 **Insertion:** You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j throuogh i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit2.\n",

    "5.2 **Binary to String:** Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.72) that is passed in as a double, print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print \"ERROR.\"\n",

    "5.3 **Flip Bit to Win:** You have an integer and you can flip exactly one bit from a 0 to a 1. Write code to find the length of the longest sequence of 1s you could create.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.4 **Next number:** Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that have the same number of 1 bits in their binary representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.5 **Debuggere:** Explain what the following code does ((n & (n - 1)) == 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.6 **Conversion:** Write a function to determine the number of bits you would need to flip to convert integer A to integer B.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.7 **Pairwise Swap:** Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible (e.g., bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.8 **Draw Line:** A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The height of the screen of course, can be derived from the length of the array and the width. Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y)."
