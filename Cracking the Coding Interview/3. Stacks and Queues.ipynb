Therefore, inreal life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once thre preicous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should be behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack)."

People must adopt either the \"oldest\" (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). They cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog, and dequeueCat. You may use the built-in LinkedList data structure."
