    "Extend the buildParseTree function to handle mathematical expressions that do not have spaces between every character.\n",
    "Modify the buildParseTree and evaluate functions to handle boolean statements (and, or, and not). Remember that “not” is a unary operator, so this will complicate your code somewhat.\n",
    "Using the findSuccessor method, write a non-recursive inorder traversal for a binary search tree.\n",
    "Modify the code for a binary search tree to make it threaded. Write a non-recursive inorder traversal method for the threaded binary search tree. A threaded binary tree maintains a reference from each node to its successor.\n",
    "Modify our implementation of the binary search tree so that it handles duplicate keys properly. That is, if a key is already in the tree then the new payload should replace the old rather than add another node with the same key.\n",
    "Create a binary heap with a limited heap size. In other words, the heap only keeps track of the n most important items. If the heap grows in size to more than n items the least important item is dropped.\n",
    "Clean up the printexp function so that it does not include an ‘extra’ set of parentheses around each number.\n",
    "Using the buildHeap method, write a sorting function that can sort a list in O(nlogn) time.\n",
    "Write a function that takes a parse tree for a mathematical expression and calculates the derivative of the expression with respect to some variable.\n",
    "Implement a binary heap as a max heap.\n",
    "Using the BinaryHeap class, implement a new class called PriorityQueue. Your PriorityQueue class should implement the constructor, plus the enqueue and dequeue methods."
